## About Me
Senior Data & BI Analyst with a track record of translating business questions into measurable outcomes. I design and deliver analytical solutions that combine strong SQL, Python and Power BI with clear stakeholder communication. My focus is to help executives and product teams make faster, better decisions through trustworthy data, compelling visuals and concise narratives. I’ve led end‑to‑end initiatives — from data modeling and ETL to KPI frameworks and executive dashboards — mentoring analysts and collaborating across Finance, Sales, Marketing and Operations.

**Focus areas:** BI strategy, KPI design, revenue and margin analytics, customer lifecycle, executive reporting, experimentation, and forecasting fundamentals.

## How I Work
- **Business‑first:** start from decisions and KPIs, not tables.  
- **Explainability:** clear SQL, documented DAX, readable notebooks, and concise write‑ups.  
- **Operational rigor:** versioned artifacts, reproducible pipelines, definitions glossary.

## Currently Working On
- Publishing a BI template repo with reusable **KPI framework** (revenue, margin, CAC, LTV, retention).  
- A short **case study series**: 5‑minute reads for executives showing the “so what” behind the charts.  
- Migrating legacy Excel reports into a governed **Power BI semantic model**.
